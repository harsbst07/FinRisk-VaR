Value at Risk (VaR)- Monte Carlo Simulation

**ðŸ“Š Monte Carlo VaR Model for Indian Large-Cap Equity Portfolio**
**Overview**

This repository contains a Monte Carlo Simulation-based Value at Risk (VaR) model applied to an equally weighted portfolio comprising five of the largest Indian publicly traded companies by market capitalization:<br>
a). Reliance Industries Ltd<br>
b). HDFC Bank Ltd<br>
c). Bharti Airtel Ltd<br>
d). Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)<br>
e). ICICI Bank Ltd<br>
The model simulates 10,000 portfolio return paths to estimate the 1-day VaR at 99% confidence level.<br>

**Objectives**<br>
a). To provide a robust quantitative framework for measuring market risk exposure using historical data and stochastic simulation techniques, enabling risk managers, analysts, and investors to:<br>
b). Estimate potential portfolio losses under normal market conditions.<br>
c). Quantify tail risk with greater accuracy than variance-covariance or historical methods.<br>
d). Support risk-adjusted portfolio decision-making.<br>

**ðŸ’¼ Real-World Applications**<br>
a). Risk Management: Banks, mutual funds, and hedge funds use VaR to limit exposure to market downturns.<br>
b). Regulatory Compliance: Financial institutions use VaR to meet capital adequacy and risk disclosure requirements (e.g., Basel III).<br>
c). Portfolio Optimization: Investors use VaR to assess downside risk and allocate capital accordingly.
